# Syrfalytics Projects

We are planning to do interesting data projects with Surfalytics community.

Our primary focus is Data Engineering and Analytics (Business Intelligence).  These projects are inspired by the legendary [MakeOverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) from the Tableau community.
We will sync in Discord weekly and talk over the projects as well as publish in Git and Medium.

1. **Azure Databricks in Virtual Network with Secure Cluster Connectivity feature.** - We will learn the basics of Microsoft Azure and Network configuration.

## List of Data Analytics projects

1. **Building end-to-end Power BI dashboard with Microsoft Fabric** - We will observe the "end to end" example from source data that will be transformed into the dashboard with insights using Microsoft Azure and Fabric.
